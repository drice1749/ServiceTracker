ADDING A NEW PLATFORM SAFELY
============================

1. Identify device family
2. Manually test CLI commands
3. Create a minimal command set
4. Validate against schema
5. Run probe on real hardware
6. Inspect artifacts manually
7. Adjust commands if needed
8. Re-run probe
9. Freeze the contract
10. Build collector logic

DO NOT:
- Copy another vendor’s contract
- Assume feature parity
- Skip real-device testing
